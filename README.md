desktop_backgrounds
===================

Pull top nature images from Reddit to be used as desktop backgrounds.

Edit the URL to point to any Reddit page. By default, it is the top 50 images from 
r/EarthPorn. Only images hosted on imgur will be pulled (for now). 

The images will be saved in a subdirectory (/img by default). Use your System Preferences/Control Pannel 
to add this directory as a source for desktop backgrounds, changing between images as often as you'd like.

I created a startup script that runs the Python file on boot to pull the latest images. I'll probably add that 
to this repo shortly.
